Make use of sent_tokenize to extract sentences from raw corpus and then word_tokenize to tokenize the sentences and then extract the sentences with "could":

>>> from nltk.corpus import brown
>>> from nltk import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
>>> corpus = " ".join(brown.words())
>>> [i for i in sent_tokenize(corpus) if u"could" in word_tokenize(i)]
To get the sentence before and after:

>>> sentences = sent_tokenize(corpus)
>>> [" ".join([sentences[i-1], j, sentences[i+1]]) for i,j in enumerate(sentences) if u"could" in word_tokenize(j)]
