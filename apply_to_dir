If You on windows, then You can write something simple (sequentional) in python:

# name: apply_script_to_glob.py
import sys, os
from glob import glob

Script = sys.argv[1]
Glob   = sys.argv[2]

Files = glob(Glob)

for File in Files:
    os.system("python2.7 " + Script + " " + File)

(again we didn't use argparse nor checked anything to keep it simple). You'd call the script with

$ python2.7 apply_script_to_glob.py "script.py" "*.txt"
