Please use the following code in Python(x,y)
which when downloaded, installs Python 2.7

Python(x,y) includes Spyder, which is a GUI where you can write code and print out 
graphs, etc. Python(x,y) carries most of the modules needed by scientists.

The following code reads in a single column of values
and feeds it to an array. The float(i) can be changed to int(i).

from matplotlib import pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

arr=[]
filename=('hg19logsamplesize.txt')
input=open(filename, "rU")
for line in input.readlines():
    for i in line.split():
        arr.append(float(i))
       
print arr

pyplot.hist(arr, bins=50,color='g')
plt.xlabel('Log(Sample Size)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Histogram of HG19 Sample Size')
